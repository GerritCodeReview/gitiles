      "message": "google3 has already moved to servlet 3.1 entirely, but when we did so, we did it with a google-internal patch to implement some of the abstract methods introduced in that version so we didn\u0027t have to atomically implement it in a bunch of clients.\n\nThis message was apparently not captured in the copybara-generated commit, but this came out of a google3 LSC, specifically child cr/417877794, which referenced go/lsc-servlet-api-v3.1 step #8.\n\nHow do I look at your follow-up change?",
