      "message": "[2] has a reference to additional justification that\u0027s been stripped out when the commit was published externally. Here\u0027s what it says:\n\nA string to use when [Soy deems] input unsafe. The string is not a substring of any keyword or well-known identifier in HTML, JS, or CSS and cannot terminate a string, comment, or other bracketed section. Additionally, the string should not result in a browser issuing a network request when used as the value of an attribute such as href or src.\n\nabout:invalid, used in the string. is registered in http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#about-invalid. http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6694#section-2.1 permits about URLs to contain a fragment, which is not to be considered when determining if an about URL is well-known.\n\nUsing about:invalid seems preferable to using a fixed data URL, since browsers might choose to not report CSP violations on it, as legitimate CSS function calls to attr() can result in this URL being produced. It also a now standard URL which matches exactly the semantics we need: \"The about:invalid URI references a non-existent document with a generic error condition. It can be used when a URI is necessary, but the default value shouldn\u0027t be resolveable as any type of document\".",
