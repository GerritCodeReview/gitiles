Gitiles - A simple JGit repository browser
==========================================

Gitiles is a simple repository browser for Git repositories, built on JGit. Its
guiding principle is simplicity: it has no formal access controls, no write
access, no fancy Javascript, etc.


Development

Gitiles requires Maven (http://maven.apache.org/) to build.

sudo apt-get install maven


Workflow

mvn compile
mvn package
./tools/run_dev.sh
open http://localhost:8080/ to view/test.

NOTE: run_dev.sh looks for git checkouts in your current working directory.
If it fails to find a git checkout you may see exceptions like:
"String index out of range: -1" when trying to load localhost:8080/


Eclipse

If you'd like to use Eclipse to edit Gitiles, you will need the m2e
eclipse plugin (http://eclipse.org/m2e/).

File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Project

Make sure that imports all 4 projects:
gitiles-parent, gitiles-dev, gitiles-servlet, gitiles-war

NOTE: m2e will assumes project names match their directory names.
If you used the default "gitiles" name for your checkout
you may need to right click on the imported "gitiles" project
choosing "Refactor -> Rename" and rename it to "gitiles-parent"
for x-project references to work correctly in Eclipse.
