      "message": "I would really rather not copy all this into this project. In the buck world we already had bucklets as a submodule so it wasn\u0027t a problem to consume it from there.\n\nNow that we have bazlets in our bazel WORKSPACE, maybe this should be a py_binary there? Then in this repo we would just have a tiny wrapper script to call \"bazel run\" with the right flags.",

      "message": "Yes, It is wrong to spread the same content of project.py across all projects. But I had hard time to make it work as you suggested. For one, it\u0027s not clear what input and output should this target define? For another there is a complication with the execution root, where this tool will be actually executed is different from the project root directory.\n\nAfter playing with it a bit, I found one way to make it work: generate a location of this tool, retrieve execution root, rellocate to bazlets package, call the script and pass in the parameters. I\u0027m sure there is a smarter way, so I\u0027m open for suggestions.",
