This way both ways will work.\n\nAt first, I tried to avoid the breaking change this way. But what can we do about `$1`? Keeping `$1` (`$1` is optional) and appending `$@` is not compatible.\n\nIf we want to avoid the breaking change, I suggest to create a new shell script.\n\n\u003e Also would be good to update the dev documentation so that it reflects how run_dev can be used to start gitiles in debug mode.\n\nAgreed. I\u0027ll do it as soon as we agree on a way to fix the previous point.",
