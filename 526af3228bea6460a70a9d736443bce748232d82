      "message": "There are a couple of advantages:\n\n* Bazel has much better isolation of subprocesses: each action is run in a sandbox. This provides better correctness guarantees, and should do away with the need to run \"buck clean\".\n\n* The test caching is a little more advanced. In particular, --no-results-cache should not be necessary for Bazel (failures aren\u0027t cached).\n\n* Bazel comes with Errorprone built in, http://errorprone.info/bugpatterns\n\n* Bazel has extensible rules (see eg.: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_scala).  In particular, we have been talking a little about using TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript. With bazel, it is easy to add support for TypeScript (there are google internal rules which should take little effort to open up.)\n\n* Bazel has support for annotating the build, in particular, for driving Kythe indexers.\nSince I\u0027m looking at how Kythe (kythe.io) could be integrated with gitiles, it seems fitting to \"dogfood\" that with gitiles.\n\n(if you don\u0027t know what Kythe is, try going to https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/base/strings/nullable_string16.h and clicking on any identifier to get a feel for things.)",

      "message": "Thanks for the thorough explanation! Those are all convincing advantages. A couple more questions:\n1. Do we plan to use TypeScript / JavaScript for new functionality? I think Gitiles is static and the code base currently doesn\u0027t have any JavaScript file.\n\n2. Besides TypeScript, have you considered alternatives like GWT or Closure-style JavaScript? Gitiles is mostly written in Java and I\u0027ve had good experience developing Gerrit in GWT / Java. As for Closure, it has much better support for minification and the Bazel rules for Closure are mostly ready at https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_closure. Gitiles is already using Closure (Soy) Templates so going with Closure seems more natural than using TypeScript.\n\n3. Adding Grok / Kythe support would be a huge plus. I\u0027ve always thought about integrating it with Gerrit but Kythe wasn\u0027t open sourced until recently. Looking forward to a prototype!\n\n4. Apparently I don\u0027t know that CodeSearch was open sourced. How was it possible without Grok / Kythe?",

I\u0027m still looking at kythe/gitiles to make up my mind on how Kythe integration into Gitiles would work.\n\n2. GWT has already been tried for Gerrit proper, and is being discarded. That said, until it\u0027s fully gone, we would have to have GWT rules out there too. The bright side is that I have access to the google internal ones (written in Java and quite horrible) to understand what they should do, and this could give me an excuse to finalize my vendetta against them. \n\n3.
