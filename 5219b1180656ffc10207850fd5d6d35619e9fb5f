Why are we so concerned with upgrading guava that we\u0027re taking all these extra steps with custom releases? This message doesn\u0027t provide any justification for updating guava versions.",

      "message": "\u003e Do we need a reason beyond \"it makes sense to keep your dependencies up-to-date\"?\n\nThanks for asking Sven, I\u0027m happy to explain more. I agree with David and I think it\u0027s great to regularly try out new versions and discover issues. That helps us later when we do discover a need for upgrading a dependency. If we have an opportunity to upgrade a dependency and there\u0027s low cost (effort for authors/reviewers), low risk, and no debt, I absolutely agree we should aim to keep those up to date.\n\nWhen we\u0027re considering adding debt (such as creating custom releases of dependency artifacts) or there\u0027s increased risk or effort, I think we need to have more scrutiny on why we\u0027re doing the upgrade. Perhaps that risk/effort/debt is warranted, but as seems to be the conclusion in this case, it won\u0027t always be.",
