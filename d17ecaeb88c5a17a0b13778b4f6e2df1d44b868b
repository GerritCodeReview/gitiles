      "message": "I\u0027m reading the docs as saying these produce:\n\n\u003ca name\u003d\"live-examples\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExamples\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nRight? IIUC, I think this various from normal markdown, which would be\n\n\u003ch2\u003eExamples\u003ca name\u003d...\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nI\u0027m not sure if it matters that much, but is there a reason not to do the latter to be more conformant?",

      "message": "Correct we will create\n\n  \u003ca name\u003d\"live-examples\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eExamples\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\nThe advantage is the anchor is at the start of the header rather than the end. For a very long header that wraps the line in the browser, jumping to the anchor will jump to the start of the header rather than the end of the header. This is useful to the reader as its awkward to see the page rendered with a partial section header at the top of the window on a very long document with a very long entry.\n\nThis may not be common in documentation but consider a FAQ page that uses [TOC] to build an auto table of frequently asked questions and auto-linking to those entries later in the document. If the document is long and some of those questions are long, this anchor approach is more reader friendly.\n\nThe reason most markdown processors just insert it at the text position is because its work to go back and muck with the AST from the parser. Here we have already done most of the effort necessary to figure out what the correct name should be for this section header so its virtually free to reorder the node.",

      "message": "I agree that you\u0027d usually want the name to be at the beginning of the heading, but it seems to me that the obvious way to do that (as an author) would be to put tag where I wanted it to be, e.g.\n\n## \u003ca name\u003d\"live-examples\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eExamples\n\nand in doing so this keeps things consistent with how HTML usually works. Having the tag move in the document seems like it might be kinda confusing (though I\u0027m sure I\u0027d get over it quickly enough).\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t think other Markdown processors would do what you\u0027re doing, and it seems like consistency is a bigger win here.\n\nAs far as the {#live-examples} variant goes, that\u0027s not standard anything (it looks more like an annotation), so I\u0027d be fine w/ that one wrapping the tag.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
