      "message": "I don\u0027t understand what this needPrefix code is trying to do. Unfortunately it\u0027s been there since day one so the commit messages don\u0027t help. Maybe dborowitz can weigh in.\n\nIs it just about producing short URLs? E.g. if we changed this line to \u0027boolean needPrefix \u003d false\u0027 and made it always include \u0027refs\u0027 in the URL, would there be any other ill effect?",

      "message": "Just always using ref.getName() and removing needPrefix is fine, it just makes the UI a little less nice looking. I wrote the shortUnambiguousRefName because I thought it would be a deal breaker to make (for example) refs/heads/master point to /+/refs/heads/master instead of the current /+/master . If not, always using fully qualified refnames is simpler and is always unambiguous.",
