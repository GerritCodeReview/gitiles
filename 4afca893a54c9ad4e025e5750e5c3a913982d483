It was at first telling me 340175 and 340180 were not submittable while the others were. I should have taken a screenshot and captured a few traces. Maybe there is a logic flow in the topic submission or it is a cache related problem.\n\nWe will see once CI is unbroken :]\n\nThank you for troubleshooting and trying to fix the chain!",
