      "message": "This is copied from lib/slf4j package and thus duplicated. We shouldn\u0027t duplicate rules, and unnecessary complicate build process. If we need to update the rule definition, we would need to do it twice: for gitiles own build and for JGit build linked as git submodule.\n\nSuggestion 1: Now, that JGit linked module requires this dependency to be in package lib:slf4j-api and not in package lib/slf4j:slf4j-api, we resolve that package entirely in gitiles build, and not just copy the rule. Hence: move both rules definitions slf4j-api and slf4j-simple to lib package, remove lib/slf4j/BUILD and adapt gitiles build to the new locations. This should be done in its own change (previous change in this series?) as preparation for this change.\n\nSuggestion 2: We could define an alias, from lib:slf4j-api to lib/slf4j:slf4j-api but given that there are only two java libraries, I would strongly prefer suggestion 1, to not add yet another level of indirection and complicate the build.",
