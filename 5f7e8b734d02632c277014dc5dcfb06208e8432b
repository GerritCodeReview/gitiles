      "message": "I could do that, but I\u0027m not sold on it being 400 rather than 404. I always thought 400 was for some malformed syntax in the request, not a semantic error in the URL.\n\nPut another way, one thing this is protecting against is fat-fingering a refname in a URL. Why should some fat-fingers (refs/head/master) cause 404s and others (refs/heads master) cause 400s?",
