If so, then I think IAE is ok behavior.\n\nIf passing unsafe UGC to the parser produces IAE, I think that\u0027s not what we want, we don\u0027t want HTTP 500 on those responses. A custom exception type or return value that the handler can catch would be better, that way we can say something like \"this document could not be rendered due to unsafe HTML\".",
